# Sourcegraph Cover Letter

2021-02-19

Dear Erica Lindberg and Sourcegraph team,

I’m applying for the Managing Editor position at Sourcegraph. I used to work with Aileen Agricola at Neo4j, and she encouraged me to apply. After _thoroughly_ lurking through your handbook, I think I could be a good fit for Sourcegraph and vice versa. Here’s why.

As a professional, I’ve completed the content marketing hat trick: freelance, agency, and in-house marketing. As with width, so with depth: I’ve also worked at every level of the editorial stack, from copywriting, editing, and publishing, to managing vendors, hiring, project management, and long-term strategy. Along the way, I’ve used much of the marketer’s toolbox: HubSpot, Marketo, Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office, WordPress, Trello, etc.

My most recent position was at Neo4j as the Senior Manager for Content Marketing where I started as a lone wolf department and ended up leading a team of six full-time employees and a turnip-truck full of freelancers and agencies. It was fun. But I bowed out because of the calcification that comes with any growing company. I prefer the agency of mapping new editorial frontiers rather than only traversing already well worn thoroughfares.

But why am I a good fit for a _tech_ startup? After college, my family convinced me to try software engineering, and I got a six-month apprenticeship as a backend developer. My number one takeaway was that I didn’t want to be a developer. My number two takeaway was that I enjoyed working _with_ developers. They shoot straight, and they don’t like bullshit marketing. But they (usually) can’t write worth beans. Fortunately, I’m a full-stack developer too, but my programming language is English (it’s open source!). Review my code for yourself.

I love to help a startup team begin from a blank page or a rough outline and then build a content and media empire. I also love to set up processes: nothing in my life isn’t on a color-coded spreadsheet or a Trello board (or both!).  I’d love to put all of the above experience, skills, and passions to work at Sourcegraph.

Let me know if you’d like to talk further,

All the best,
